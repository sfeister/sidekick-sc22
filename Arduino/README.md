# Arduino

Each Raspberry Pi has exactly one or more Arduinos attached. The Raspberry Pi sends commands and receives data from the Arduino(s) via USB.

Each .ino sketch in this folder is compiled and uploaded to an Arduino Nano or Arduino Uno. Then, the Arduino is plugged into a Raspberry Pi via USB.
